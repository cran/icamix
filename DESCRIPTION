Description: The icamix package provides R functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the estimation of ICA mixture models. We have developed and implemented the NSMM-ICA algorithm that currently integrates npEM and Fast-ICA for non-parametric estimation of ICA mixture models. We will continue to build in algorithms that interweave the EM step with other types of ICA techniques.
